# RSpec Practice

This is a simple app to help students practice writing specs with RSpec. The front-end is done. It's now up to our server-side web developer to write specs for the methods they want, then fill out the logic for _at least_ the first 3 helper methods of [our `MethodsPracticeHelper` module](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/codelab-sinatra-tdd-rspec-intro/blob/master/helpers/methods_practice_helpers.rb).

## How to work on this

Using what you learned in [the lesson](http://lansingcodelab.com/lessons/sinatra-tdd-rspec-intro/1) and copying the format of the specs from [the previous project](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/codelab-sinatra-tdd-helper-methods/tree/master/spec/helpers/methods_practice_helpers), write your own specs for any methods you fill out in [`helpers/methods_practice_helpers.rb`](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/codelab-sinatra-tdd-rspec-intro/blob/master/helpers/methods_practice_helpers.rb). Test as you go with `bundle exec guard` (or `bundle exec rspec` if you're on Windows).
